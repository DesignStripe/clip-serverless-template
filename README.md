Setup and host CLIP on Banana in minutes

# Deploying to Banana hosted Serverless GPUs:

1) Fork this repo

2) [Log into the Banana dashboard](https://app.banana.dev/) and get your API Key

3) Email us at `onboarding@banana.dev` with the following message:
```
Hello, I'd like to be onboarded to serverless.
My github username is: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
My Banana API Key is: YOUR_API_KEY
My preferred billing email is: YOU@EMAIL.COM
```
Your github username, banana api key, and email are required for us to authorize you into the system. 
We will reply and confirm when you're added.

4) Install the [Banana Github App](https://github.com/apps/banana-serverless) to the forked repo. 

5) Push to main to trigger a build and deploy to the hosted backend. This will do nothing if you have not completed the email in step 2 above.

6) Monitor your email inbox for status updates, which will include a unique model key for this repo for you to use through the Banana SDKs.
